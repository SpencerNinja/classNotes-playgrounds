 Unit Test
    A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, this is a function, subroutine, method, or a property.
 
 Test Driven Development
    Test driven development (TDD) is a code design technique where the programmer writes a test before any production code, and then writes the code that will make that test pass. The idea is taht with a tiny bit of assurance from that initial test, the programmer can feel free to refactor and refactor some more to get the cleanest code they know how to write.
    The idea is simple, but like most simple things, the execution is hard, TDD requires a completely different mindset from what most people are used to and the tenacity to deal with a learning curve that may slow you down at first.
