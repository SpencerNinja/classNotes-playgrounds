/**
 The next one was to create a code that evaluated the greyness of a pixel.

 The next had an array with strings of numbers. 1 = black and 0 = white. I needed to separate the strings change the string value to an integer and then calculate the “greyness” of a row or column by the sum.

 That one was a bit confusing and I spent the first part thinking they wanted me to find the hourglass in the 2d array. So I lost a lot of time doing that.
 
 Example:
 
You have an array like {  {1010}, {0101}, {1010} }
 Find the sume of each row to find the greyness which looks like:
 1 0 1 0
 0 1 0 1
 1 0 1 0
 1 = black
 0 = white
